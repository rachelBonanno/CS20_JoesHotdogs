# CS 20 Web Programming Assignment: Joe’s Hotdogs
## Deliverables
PDF file containing all code and the URL of the page online.  You may use your github or cpanel 
hosting.
## Objectives
Create an interactive experience using Javascript
## Tasks
Your assignment is to create a web page to get an order for a new café called “Joe’s Hotdog 
Stand”.  Joe’s only sells three items: hotdogs ($4.25 each), French Fries ($2.60 each) and Drinks 
($1.50 each).  Joe is swamped due to his incredible hotdog recipe and is hoping online orders will 
help to manage the flow better.
When the user runs the page (i.e., enters the url) do the following:
- Using prompt(), ask the user three questions- how many hotdogs do they want, how many 
fries do they want and how many sodas do they want.  When you get the values, store 
them in variables or an array.
- Calculate the subtotal for the order based on the pricing and the quantities requested. Store in a variable.
- Implement Joe’s special offer - 10% discount if the order (before tax) is at least $20.  Update the subtotal.  Store the discount amount in a variable.
- Add 6.25% Massachusetts meals tax to the subtotal.  This is the final amount the customer will need to pay.
- Display all order information below on the page:  
  - Items ordered and quantities
  - subtotals
  - discount, if applicable
  - tax
  - final total.  
  - All currency values must be rounded to 2 decimal places.
